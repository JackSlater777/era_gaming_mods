New Spells Plugin

Quite recently (August) I was challenged with a task of adding new spells to the game via a plugin for the HD mod. I said then that it's quite easy to implement, meaning the very core mechanics.

Now I and Rolex, another user from HandBookHMM (who is the graphic designer of the project btw), can present the plugin which actually allows you to add new spells, with some spells already added by us as examples.

16 new spells have been added (well, some of them are not quite new, but we don't have a lot of original graphics and animations anyway).

Earth Magic: Poison, Disease, Fear, Death Cloud, Drain Life
Fire Magic: Mobility, Age, Death Blow, Behemoth's Claws, Incineration, Explosion, Summon Firebird
Water Magic: Toughness
Air Magic: Eye of the Magi, Summon Sprite
And Summon Magic Elemental which went to every magic school.

All spell work and AI can use them, except Mobility.

Added new special features for Explosion and Incineration spells which add a lot to the tactical component of the battle and can turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Added two new spells - Hour of Power and Golden Touch - by Szaman.

Don't miss Golden Touch if you think money is the key to success.

Thanks to daemon_n for the valuable bug report on Admiral's Hat
