General:

Era Scripts is a mod/script-pack that adds many additional features/options to the game.
New options are on the last two tabs of the "WoG Options" menu.
The mod can be run with or without an HD mod.

Requirements and recommendations:
To run the mod requires Era platform version 2.9.12 or newer. The mod works on top of the basic WoG mod, full compatibility with other mods (except those that change graphics/interface elements) is not guaranteed.

Attention! Attention! Attention!

Since version 1.37, the mod contains the ReMagic mod option.
In order to avoid conflicts, do not forget to disable a separate ReMagic mod if you used it.

The mod, especially ReMagic mod option, would possibly prohibit from completion some custom WoG or SoD maps, because of the Town Portal modified spell, so in that case you can disable ReMagic option.

For correct mod work, before installing, you need to remove the previous version of the mod (delete the "Mods\ERA scripts Eng" directory).
